I started my day today in the same manner as I do on weekdays.
This week, since I'm working from home, I've been cleaning my house before preparing for my office work. Later in the day, after finishing my office tasks, I dedicate time to thoroughly enhancing my communication skills on YouTube, where I've discovered several relevant videos on the topic.
The person on YouTube gave lots of useful advice in the video, like reading English books and newspapers, and watching English movies.
Out of all these practical suggestions, the one that resonates with me the most is the idea of recording yourself speaking on a topic for 5 minutes every day and then reviewing the video afterward.
To enhance my communication skills, I have chosen to do this video practical along with my journal writing

So on Sunday, my friends and I searched for a new gym near our apartment as we were not satisfied with the old one, which is a stone's throw away from our home. We found a new gym at the mall, which is approximately 1.5 km away, and the gym was well-equipped. So, we decided to join and start from Monday. We also suggested the new gym to our other friends and shared pictures; they were also impressed. In the evening, I went to a laptop repair shop to fix my laptop's slowness issue. The laptop engineer suggested that I increase the RAM size and provided me with a few brand names available at his shop. However, I am looking for some branded RAM so that later on, I will not face any issues. So, I decided to check RAM at a bigger shop on Tilak Road next weekend

Fortunately, we were more fortunate than other new students because one of my friends had an older brother who was already working in Pune.

I just want to share my old memories of buying my first book apart form my academics books and how this memory triggered in my mind.
So on Wednesday in my office I supposed to narrate a story in front officemate there for I have just chosen a story from my childhood book named Panchatantra.
This book I purchased from a book fair where I want accidentenly, actually I went to a drawing competition with my father in my home town Bokaro. And that drawing competition location is near to a book fair.
With a few of my friends and my father, we went there to check out some books. At that time I was in 5th standard
and I enjoyed immensely reading ficitional books so I purchased the Panchatantra story book.
At the book fair we saw many books on different categories like politics, science, religious and many more.
It's a kind of haven for book lovers specially when internet was not available easily at times.
Till now I have read many books, but in hind language that was the first books I read.
And it's nice to story book to gift to a child as after every story a moral message conveys to its reader and this book is typically targeted for children only where mostly stories revolving around a hypothetical animal charachter who can talk to each other. 
From my point view this is the best book we can give to any kids. 
then later on year I went there for once but then never got a chance to visit there don't know still happening or not

I want to share a memory about buying my first non-academic book and how it came to mind recently. One Wednesday at work, I had to tell a story to my colleagues, so I chose one from a childhood book called Panchatantra.

I got this book at a book fair while attending a drawing competition with my dad in my hometown, Bokaro. I was in 5th grade at the time and loved reading fiction. The book fair had books on politics, science, and religion, making it a paradise for book lovers, especially when internet access wasn't common.

Panchatantra was my first book in Hindi, and I've read many more since then. It's a great gift for kids because each story teaches a moral lesson, usually involving talking animals. I visited the fair again the following year but haven't had the chance to go back since. I wonder if it's still happening.

I just want to share my experience on the first day of college. 
I joined for a BCA course in Indira college Pune as I joined college in 2 months late.
So joining formalities for students are already done so on the first day I supposed to do that so I was busy in joining formalities on the first day.
In this college I have already friends, who are from my home town and I am trying to enroll in their section only as we had section A and B for the first year.
Admissions department told me to go the library and create your library card first, so I went to the library to get my ID card
In the library I meet two more students who went there for a library card, initially I thought they already joined the college like other and they visited the library for books, but they also joined late college like me and In the library they also come for their ID cards 
One of them asked me for the library card form and I told him you will get this from library peon.
Later on by talking with them I realized that both of them are from Mumbai.
Now only remember one student name, and his name is Aamir. While helping them to filling their library form I noticed that Aamir and my birthday are the on same day that is 20 April. Intailly I thought accidentenly copy same date of birth while taking refernce of form.
Later on we visited the BCA deparment HOD office for class allocation and done with our joining in
But later on I realized that I did not get the desired section where friends are enrolled as seats are already filled.
As I and Aamir was new to this class, we seated on same three seater bench. After that during breaks I was talking to other students as well then I wonder that they are 5 to 7 studends are from my home town.I never meet them before It surprised me because I belong to a very small town  of Jharkhand from there, more then 10 students are in BCA 1st year and I already knew many seniors from different streams from my home town are studying in the same college.
After lunch I attented the class and only two periods are remaining for the day as I need to skip the first 2 class as I was busy in joining formalities.
one of my friends kindly dropped me off near my apartment with his bike

I'd like to recount my experience from the initial day at college. Enrolling late, I commenced my BCA course at Indira College in Pune, arriving two months behind schedule. Consequently, as the enrollment procedures had already been concluded, my focus on the inaugural day revolved around fulfilling these requirements. Familiar faces from my hometown were already established in the college, prompting my endeavor to secure a place in their designated section, denoted as either A or B for the freshman year. Directed by the admissions department, I headed to the library to acquire my ID card. While there, I encountered two fellow students also in pursuit of library cards. Initially assuming they had already commenced their studies like the others, I later discovered they were newcomers like myself, visiting the library for the same reason. When one of them requested the library card form, I directed him to the library peon. Through subsequent conversation, I learned that both hailed from Mumbai. I distinctly recall the name of one of them, Aamir, whose birthday coincided with mine, on the 20th of April. Initially dismissing this as a coincidental error, we proceeded to the BCA department's HOD office for class allocation, finalizing our enrollment. Subsequently, I realized that I hadn't secured placement in the desired section where my friends were enrolled, as all seats had been filled. Consequently, Aamir and I found ourselves seated together on a three-seater bench, being newcomers to the class. During breaks, I conversed with other students and was surprised to discover that 5 to 7 of them hailed from my hometown, whom I hadn't previously encountered. This revelation astonished me, considering my hometown's small size in Jharkhand, yet having over 10 students in the BCA first year, along with several familiar seniors across different streams in the college. Following lunch, I attended the remaining two periods for the day, having skipped the first two due to enrollment formalities. In the evening, One of my friends gave me a ride on his motorcycle and dropped me off near my apartment.

I do like to recount my experience about my first mobile phone purchased in my home. My father purchased that mobile phone in the year of 2004. It was Nokia 2600 colour series phone and we were very excited for that particular phone as that time Nokia phone was a big sensation. In that era of time, there were no Iphones and other big branded mobile phone are available, So every people wanted and looked to Nokia as a branded mobile phone.
We bought a colour phone and including features likes loud speaker, games, radio etc. This features seems nothing nowadays but back in early 2000's it was a big deal to have all these features inside a phone.
In the year of 2004 camera phones are also available, But they are quit expansive and cameras are also not good if 
compare with today's cheapest phone.
The best thing about thses phone which I liked the most is radio features because at time we need to buy a separate radio set which is completely eliminated nowadays.
There is also a feature that I liked was ringtones, we can set ringtones as per the latest songs.
Even you can send this ringtones to friends.
We bought this phone from the authorized Nokia dealer shop so dealer provided us 100 ringtones for free.
We played games a lot in mobile phone.
Appart form all these features, improved connectivity among our family, relatives, and friends before that we need to realy on Phone booth for calls also need wait over there, some important or in situation of emergency, we received information little late for this, I was grateful.

I would like to share my experience regarding the first mobile phone purchased in my household. In 2004, my father bought a Nokia 2600 color series phone, which brought a lot of excitement to our family. During that time, Nokia phones were highly coveted, as there were no iPhones or other major branded mobile phones available. Nokia was considered a prestigious brand in the mobile phone market.

This phone was equipped with various features such as a loudspeaker, games, and radio, which may seem commonplace now but were quite remarkable in the early 2000s. Although camera phones were also available in 2004, they were expensive and had inferior camera quality compared to even the most basic phones available today.

One feature that stood out to me was the built-in radio, as it eliminated the need for a separate radio set, which was common at the time. Additionally, I appreciated the ability to set custom ringtones, including the latest songs, and even share them with friends. When we purchased the phone from an authorized Nokia dealer, we were given 100 free ringtones, which added to the excitement.

We spent a lot of time playing games on the phone. In addition to these features, the initial mobile phone at home significantly improved connectivity among our family, relatives, and friends. Before its arrival, we had to rely on local phone booths for calls, often requiring us to wait there. In crucial situations or emergencies, we sometimes received information with a delay. For this, I was grateful.

3rd march 2024

I would like to share about one of the my childhood memories about 3rd march Founder’s Day celebration in Tata city also know as Jamshedpur.
We celebrate this day to mark the birth anniversary of the founder of Tata group, Jamsetji Tata.
Who was founder of Tata steel company in the Jamshedpur city.
In this city my grandfather and my uncles were living and we use to visit them in every major festival.
Once me and family visited the Tata city and luckly we went that city on that Founder’s Day.
So our family started planning for the evening fair and all this was new to me as I never had been visited Tata city on Founder’s Day.
Therefore I started questioning to my cousin about it, Like where we are going in the evening what kind of celebration, this is ?
My cousin sister replied that there is big park named Jubilee Park where a light and fountains show will take place, and there will be many food and toy shops that will be open temporarily.
We all are excited and preparing for the evening. The location was about 5 km away from our home.
When we reached to the Jubilee park I saw there was a huge crowd all people excited for light and fountains show.
The light decoration in Jubilee park was amazing and not only the park was decorated but the whole city was decorated.
In the park using light, many shapes are created like animals, birds and human which I have never seen before.
Also fountains show was amazing.
We ate our dinner there only in the food stalls and also buy few toys from shop.
We get tired so much due walking as the park was huge and light shows happened in the different part of the park and more than 50 different light shows were happed there.
We all reached at home in the midnight, although many people still there till the sunrise.
I think its more than 15 years passed I did not visit the city on the Founder’s Day although I visited the city regulary.

I'd like to recount one of my childhood memories from March 3rd, the celebration of Founder’s Day in Tata city, also known as Jamshedpur. This day commemorates the birth anniversary of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group and the Tata Steel Company in Jamshedpur. My grandfather and uncles resided in this city, so we often visited them during major festivals. On one such occasion, we happened to visit Tata city on Founder’s Day.

The family began planning for the evening fair, which was entirely new to me since I had never experienced Founder’s Day in Tata city before. Curious, I bombarded my cousin with questions about where we were headed and what kind of celebrations awaited us. She explained that there would be a grand event at Jubilee Park, featuring a light and fountain show along with temporary food and toy stalls. Excitedly, we prepared for the evening, which was about 5 km away from our home.

Upon arrival at Jubilee Park, we were met with a massive crowd eagerly awaiting the light and fountain show. The park and the entire city were adorned with stunning light decorations, creating intricate shapes of animals, birds, and humans, unlike anything I had seen before. The fountain show was equally mesmerizing. We indulged in dinner at the food stalls and bought a few toys from the shops.

The vastness of the park and the numerous light shows happening simultaneously made for an exhausting but exhilarating experience. After witnessing over 50 different light displays, we finally headed home, arriving well into the midnight hours, while many people continued to enjoy the festivities until sunrise.

It's been over 15 years since that memorable Founder’s Day celebration in Tata city, and although I've visited the city regularly since then, I haven't had the chance to experience another Founder’s Day celebration.
