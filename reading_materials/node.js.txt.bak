Java Script : 
======================

# Ternary operator: 

val test = true
test ? console.log("pass") : console.log("fail")

>> test

# Scope chaining in javascript :

-> In nested function the inner most function have access to variable of all above function. 
-> And the function which is not the inner most function but also located inside the other function, irrespective of any level of nesting functionn have also access to outer level of variable but not the inner function var.
-> Outer most variable have only access to its variable only in nested function.

# Array 

-> Add data into array	
	var arr  = []
	arr.push("mon");
	arr.push("tue");
	
-> loop a arr :
-> run loop in arr except few element in array

	for(let = i; i< arr.length; i++) {
	if (typeof mystates[i] !== "string") continue;
	console.log(arr[i]);
	}
	
# Loop of and Loop in

-> loop of: use iterate array.
-> loop in: use to iterate object.

# Bind :
	
	Borrow a method using bind
	
	var sunil = {
					firstName: "Sunil",
					lastName: "Kumar",
					"city":"Pune",
					getInfo: function() {
					console.log(`
					First name is ${firstName}
					Last name is ${lastName}
					City is ${city}
					`);
											},				
					};
					
					sunil.getInfo()
					
	
		var arjun = {
					firstName: "Arjun",
					lastName: "Singh",
					"city":"Pune"	
					};
					
		// bind function with other object
		
		sunil.getInfo(arjun)() // 1st way
		
		var ajju = sunil.getInfo(arjun) // 2nd way
		ajju()

2. optional operator

Using the optional chaining operator and the nullish coalescing operator together, we can safely access properties of nested objects without worrying about whether they exist or not.

So the code req.locals.user.language ? req.locals.user.language : 'EN' can be simplified to req.locals.user?.language ?? 'EN'.

The ?? operator is known as the nullish coalescing operator and returns the right-hand side operand if the left-hand side operand is null or undefined. In this case, if user is not defined, the req.locals.user?.language expression will evaluate to undefined, and the nullish coalescing operator will return the default value 'EN'.	

3. API design principles: Consider the principles of API design, such as the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and the Open-Closed Principle (OCP). SRP suggests that each API should have a single responsibility, which supports modularity and maintainability. OCP encourages open for extension and closed for modification. If you anticipate more changes or additions to the API in the future, adhering to these principles might guide you towards creating a new API endpoint

# version change issue:


Certainly! Here's an example to illustrate how language features and syntax improvements in newer versions of Node.js can affect your codebase when upgrading from version 9 to version 16:

Suppose you have the following code written in Node.js version 9:

```javascript
const fetchData = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Perform asynchronous operation
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
      resolve(data);
    }, 2000);
  });
};

fetchData()
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data.name);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

In this code, a function called `fetchData` returns a promise that resolves with some data after a delay. The `then` method is used to handle the resolved promise, and the `catch` method is used to handle any errors.

Now, let's say you upgrade to Node.js version 16, which includes support for the optional chaining operator (`?.`) and the nullish coalescing operator (`??`). You decide to refactor your code to take advantage of these new language features:

```javascript
const fetchData = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Perform asynchronous operation
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
      resolve(data);
    }, 2000);
  });
};

fetchData()
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data?.name); // Optional chaining operator
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

In this updated code, the optional chaining operator (`?.`) is used when accessing the `name` property of the `data` object. This operator allows you to safely access nested properties without causing an error if any of the intermediate properties are undefined or null. It provides a convenient way to handle potential null or undefined values in an object traversal.

The use of the optional chaining operator helps ensure that the code doesn't throw an error if `data` or `name` is not defined. It provides a more concise and safer way to access nested properties without the need for manual null or undefined checks.

This example demonstrates how language features and syntax improvements introduced in newer Node.js versions can enhance your code by providing more concise and robust ways of handling common scenarios. However, it's important to review the release notes and ensure that your codebase is compatible with the new language features, as older code may need to be modified to work correctly in the updated version.

==================================================================================================

ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced several new features and enhancements to JavaScript. Here are some of the basic ES6 features:

1. let and const: The `let` and `const` keywords allow you to declare block-scoped variables. Variables declared with `let` can be reassigned, while variables declared with `const` are read-only and cannot be reassigned.

2. Arrow Functions: Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions. They have implicit return and lexical scoping of `this`.

3. Template Literals: Template literals allow for more flexible string interpolation and multiline strings. They are denoted by backticks (`).

4. Destructuring Assignment: Destructuring assignment allows you to extract values from arrays or objects into distinct variables using a concise syntax.

5. Spread Syntax: The spread syntax (`...`) allows you to expand an iterable (like an array) into individual elements. It can be used for array concatenation, object merging, and function argument spreading.

6. Object Literal Enhancements: ES6 introduced shorthand syntax and computed property names in object literals. It allows you to write object properties without explicitly specifying the key and use variables as property names.

7. Classes: ES6 introduced a class syntax for creating objects with constructors, methods, and inheritance. It provides a more familiar syntax for developers coming from other object-oriented languages.

8. Modules: ES6 introduced a standardized module system for organizing and sharing JavaScript code. Modules allow you to export and import functionality between different files.

9. Promises: Promises provide a more elegant way to handle asynchronous operations and avoid callback hell. They represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and allow you to chain multiple operations together.

10. Default Parameters: ES6 allows you to set default values for function parameters, which are used when the corresponding argument is not provided.

These are just a few of the basic ES6 features. ES6 introduced many other features like iterators, generators, enhanced object literals, map and set data structures, and more. These features have greatly improved JavaScript's capabilities and made the language more expressive and powerful.
