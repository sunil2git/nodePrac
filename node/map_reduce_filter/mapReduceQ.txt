1.Count Words in a Sentence:
Write a function that takes a sentence as input and returns an object containing the count of each unique word. 
Use map to split the sentence into an array of words, filter to remove any non-alphabetic characters, 
and reduce to count the occurrences of each word.

2.Calculate Average Word Length:
Given a sentence, calculate the average length of the words. Use map to get an array of word lengths, reduce to sum them up, 
and then divide by the total number of words.

3.Filter and Sum Odd Numbers:
Given an array of numbers, use filter to select only the odd numbers, then use reduce to find the sum of those odd numbers.

4.Flatten and Filter Arrays:
Given an array of arrays containing both numbers and strings, use reduce to flatten the arrays into a single array, 
and then use filter to select only the numbers.

5.Group Words by Length:
Given an array of words, group them by their length. The result should be an object where keys are word lengths, 
and values are arrays of words of that length. Use reduce to build the object and map to iterate through the words.

6. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns an object containing the count of each vowel (a, e, i, o, u). 
Use the reduce method to count the occurrences of each vowel.
